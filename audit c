A software code audit is a comprehensive 
analysis of source code in a programming project with the intent of discovering bugs,
security breaches or violations of programming conventions. It is an integral part of the defensive
programming paradigm, which attempts to reduce errors before 
the software is released. C and C++ source code is the most common code to be audited since
many higher-level languages, such as Python, have fewer potentially vulnerable functions 
(e.g., functions that do not check bounds).
